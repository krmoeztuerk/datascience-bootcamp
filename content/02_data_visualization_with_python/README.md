# 2. Data Visualization with Python

## 2.1 General Topic Overview

## What is it about? 
* Getting to know the practical and theoretical approach to data visualization using Python. 

## What exactly will I learn? 
* Using established packages for visualizing data such as matplotlib and seaborn, among others, as well as tips for general data visualization.

## How do I learn all this?
* After a lecture part to execute and try out the code snippets by yourself, the lab part will include tasks that you have to solve by yourself and apply what you have learned. 
* After working out the notebooks, you should have the basics of data visualization with Python!
